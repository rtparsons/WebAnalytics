DEMO WEB ANALYTICS PROJECT

The goal of this project is to take a web page/ web site, request the resources from it, and then process them to show some interesting stats about it. E.g. Most frequently appearing words on the website.

This is a work in progress and will likely evolve and change shape over time.

TODO:

Group the running of the analysers + create a common interface for them.
Add analysers to DI.
Introduce database to store analysis results.
